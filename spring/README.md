**Summary:** In the spring semester we'll focus on many ideas from [Modern Portfolio Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_portfolio_theory), such as Asset Pricing, Factor Analysis, and Portfolio Optimization.

**Goals:** The goals of the semester are to:
  - Learn how to analyze factors and build models to predict returns
  - Construct optimal portfolios that obey given risk tolerances
  - Deploy our own Long-Short Equity Strategies to [paper trade](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/papertrade.asp) into the summer
  - Learn how to analyze the results of backtest

**Projects:** There will be two projects given out
